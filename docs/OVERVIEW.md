# HealthShift Codebase Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the HealthShift healthcare worker management system codebase for reviewers.

## üéØ What This Application Does

HealthShift is a location-based shift management system designed for healthcare organizations. It ensures workers can only clock in when they're physically present at designated work locations, provides real-time staff monitoring for managers, and offers comprehensive analytics for operational insights.

### Core Functionality
1. **Workers**: Clock in/out with GPS location validation, view current shift status
2. **Managers**: Set up work perimeters, monitor staff in real-time, analyze shift data
3. **System**: Automatic notifications, location tracking, audit trails

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend Framework
- **Next.js 15** with App Router for modern React development
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **Ant Design** for professional healthcare-appropriate UI components
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and responsive design

### Key Technologies
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with Google OAuth
- **Location Services**: Browser Geolocation API with custom abstractions
- **Charts**: Chart.js for analytics visualization
- **PWA**: next-pwa for Progressive Web App capabilities
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with SQLite (development)

### Key Files
- **`lib/location.ts`**: Core GPS and location services
- **`lib/clock.ts`**: Clock in/out operations with validation
- **`lib/perimeter.ts`**: Work area boundary management
- **`context/ShiftContext.tsx`**: Global state management
- **`hooks/useLocation.ts`**: React hook for location services

## üîë Core Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Location-Based Clock System
```typescript
// Workers can only clock in within designated perimeters
const validation = perimeterManager.validateClockOperation(
  userLocation, 
  'clock_in'
)

if (validation.allowed) {
  await clockManager.clockIn(userId, location, note)
}
```

### ‚úÖ Real-Time Staff Monitoring
```typescript
// Managers see live staff locations and status
const activeShifts = clockManager.getAllActiveShifts()
const staffWithLocation = staff.map(member => ({
  ...member,
  currentShift: activeShifts.find(shift => shift.userId === member.id),
  isInPerimeter: checkLocationInPerimeter(member.location)
}))
```

### ‚úÖ Intelligent Notifications
```typescript
// Automatic alerts when entering/leaving work areas
notificationService.processLocationUpdate(newLocation)
// Sends browser notifications for perimeter changes
```

### ‚úÖ Comprehensive Analytics
```typescript
// Rich analytics with multiple chart types
const analytics = {
  dailyHours: generateDailyTrends(),
  staffPerformance: calculateStaffMetrics(),
  shiftPatterns: analyzeClockInPatterns(),
  departmentBreakdown: categorizeByDepartment()
}
```

## üé® User Interface Design

### Worker Interface
- **Simple Clock Interface**: Large, clear clock in/out buttons
- **Location Status**: Real-time display of perimeter compliance
- **Shift Tracking**: Current shift duration and details
- **Notifications**: Smart alerts for location changes

### Manager Interface
- **Tabbed Dashboard**: Staff Overview, Analytics, Perimeter Management
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live staff location and status updates
- **Perimeter Configuration**: Visual work area setup with current location
- **Rich Analytics**: Interactive charts and performance metrics

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for healthcare workers on mobile devices
- **PWA Features**: Installable as native app on mobile
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on iOS Safari, Android Chrome, desktop browsers

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy

### Authentication
- **Google OAuth 2.0**: Secure authentication with automatic role assignment
- **Role-Based Access**: Strict separation between worker and manager features
- **Protected Routes**: Route-level security enforcement

### Location Privacy
- **Minimal Storage**: Location data used only for validation, not stored long-term
- **Permission Transparency**: Clear explanation of why location access is needed
- **Accuracy Requirements**: High-accuracy GPS required for reliable validation

### Data Security
- **Environment Variables**: Secure credential management through DevServerControl
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without sensitive data exposure

## üîÑ Data Flow

### Location Update Flow
1. **GPS Update**: Browser provides new location coordinates
2. **Accuracy Check**: Validate GPS accuracy meets requirements
3. **Perimeter Validation**: Check if location is within work boundaries
4. **Notification Processing**: Generate alerts for perimeter changes
5. **UI Updates**: Update location status displays
6. **Manager Sync**: Real-time updates to manager dashboards

### Clock Operation Flow
1. **Location Validation**: Verify user is in correct location
2. **Permission Check**: Ensure user can perform clock operation
3. **Data Recording**: Store clock event with location and timestamp
4. **Shift Management**: Update active shift status
5. **Analytics Update**: Include in performance metrics
